# Week-10

I made a band webpage for my brother and his friend. I used the tools we learned throughout this course to encode in HTML, leverage the CSS framework Bootstrap in the way I wanted, make the webpage responsive to different devices, and add media to the webpage. I chose to make a band page for my brother just because I thought it'd be fun to do.
